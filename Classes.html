        <h2>let your yoga dance</h2>
        <p>It is an amazing Chakra Fusion!  Combining yoga, the breath, and user-friendly dance with great music, it is a sacred, inspirational dance of the multi-dimensional self, bringing tons of fun and healing to body, mind, and spirit. Our seven energy centers (chakras) provide the foundation for this dance of yoga, inviting the energy to flow upward from the base of our spine up through the crown of the head, and back down to the earth again.  Result? A blissful body, joyous heart, and a steady and quiet mind. Let Your Yoga Dance&reg; is for every body and wonderful for all ages.</p>
